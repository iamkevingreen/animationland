~~~ Learning how to use [PIXI.js](http://pixijs.github.io/)

Includes the following:

- [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) (with [browserify-shim](https://github.com/thlorenz/browserify-shim))
- [Watchify](https://github.com/substack/watchify) (caching version of browserify for super fast rebuilds)
- [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) (super fast libsass with [source maps](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-ruby-sass#sourcemap), and [autoprefixer](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-autoprefixer))
- [BrowserSync](http://browsersync.io) for live reloading and a static server
- [Image optimization](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-imagemin)
- Error handling in the console [and in Notification Center](https://github.com/mikaelbr/gulp-notify)
- Shimming non common-js vendor code with other dependencies (like a jQuery plugin)
- Separate minification task for production builds


TO use:

### Install npm dependencies
```
npm install
```


### Run gulp
```
gulp
```

This will run the `default` gulp task defined in `gulp/tasks/default.js`, which has the following task dependencies: `['sass', 'images', 'html', 'watch']`
- The `sass` task compiles your css files.
- `images` moves images copies images from a source folder, performs optimizations, the outputs them into the build folder
- `html` doesn't do anything in dev, but minifies HTML for production
- `watch` has `watchify` as a dependency, which will run the browserifyTask with a `devMode` flag that enables sourcemaps and watchify, a browserify add-on that enables caching for super fast recompiling. The task itself starts watching source files and will re-run the appropriate tasks when those files change.

### Configuration
All paths and plugin settings have been abstracted into a centralized config object in `gulp/config.js`. Adapt the paths and settings to the structure and needs of the project.


#### Production files

There is also a `production` task you can run:
```
gulp production
```
This will run JavaScript tests, then re-build optimized, compressed css and js files to the build folder, as well as output their file sizes to the console. It's a shortcut for running the following tasks: `images`, `minify-html`, `minify-css`, `uglifyJs`.
